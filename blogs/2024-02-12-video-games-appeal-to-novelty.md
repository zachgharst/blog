# Video games and the appeal to novelty

Have you ever been in this position? A friend wants you to play a brand new
game in a favorite series, which is getting so-so reviews. If it wasn't a new
installment in a favorite series, it probably wouldn't get much attention. But
it's new! People have been waiting years for it! But it's also $70. It has
enough bugs that you'll encounter some frustrating ones. There aren't any mods
to enhance the experience.

Why would I play a new video game, let's say Borderlands 3 or Back 4 Blood,
when there are older video games that are very much like it and well received
(for good reason) like Borderlands 2 or Left 4 Dead 2 that I still haven't
played? These games are cheap, nearly all of their bugs are fixed, and they
have tons of amazing DLC built in to the GOTY edition.

New means new and old means old. **That's it.** You can not make any more definite
value statements based on those descriptions. A new video game *can* be better
(sorry to all of you "I was born in the wrong generation" types), but it can
also be worse. Saying that something is better purely because it's newer is the
appeal to novelty fallacy, which contrasts with its counterpart, the appeal to
tradition fallacy.
